<h2 class="text-center">What does Freed Jazz do?</h2>
<p class="fs-5">
  We aim to be a comprehensive catalog of jazz standards in the
  <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/Public_domain">U.S. public domain</a>. For
  each standard, we create a lead sheet based on its public domain publication
  and add standard contemporary chord changes. We also add lyrics and provide
  transpositions for every key. All of Freed Jazz's work is itself released into
  the public domain.
</p>

<p class="fs-5" %>
  Our work builds on top of <a href="https://imslp.org">IMSLP</a> and is
  inspired by <a href="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard Ebooks</a>.
