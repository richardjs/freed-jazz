<h2 class="text-center">What does Freed Jazz do?</h2>

<p class="fs-5">
  In the United States, works published 95 years ago&mdash;before 1929
  &mdash;are <a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/IMSLP:Copyright_Made_Simple">in
  the public domain</a>. This includes <a href="songs/">many jazz standards</a>, such as
  <a href="songs/blue-skies/">Blue Skies</a>,
  <a href="songs/someone-to-watch-over-me/">Someone to Watch Over Me</a>, and
  <a href="songs/after-youve-gone/">After You've Gone</a>. Every year more
  enter the public domain!
</p>

<p class="fs-5">
  Freed Jazz is dedicated to these standards. We publish lead sheets for each,
  complete with lyrics, contemporary changes, and transpositions to every key.
  All of our work is itself released into the public domain, and is available
  <b>completely free</b>.
</p>

<p class="fs-5" %>
  Our work builds on top of the invaluable cataloging work of <a
  href="https://imslp.org">IMSLP</a> and is inspired by the wonderful <a
  href="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard Ebooks</a> project.
